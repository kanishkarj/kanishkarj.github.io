Hi!

Welcome to my blog, I am glad you are visiting this page. I'm a Computer science and Tech fanatic, I just finished my undergraduate studies in Computer Science from IIT Indore, India.
I have seen the world evolve from DSL to experimenting with 5G networks. The fast-paced and ever-improving tools and ideas drive and inspire me to
unravel the innumerable strands of knowledge. 

My Interests and work consist of Computer systems, infrastructure, and language runtimes. Have something interesting to talk
about, catch me up on twitter!
